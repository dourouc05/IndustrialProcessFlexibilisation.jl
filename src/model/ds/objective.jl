"""
An objective function for the production model. As per its interface, it can define two functions:

  - `objectiveTimeStep(m::Model, o::ProductionObjective, pm::PlantModel, d::DateTime)`: the cost for the time step `d`
    (`d` indicates the beginning of the time step).
  - `objectiveShift(m::Model, o::ProductionObjective, pm::PlantModel, d::DateTime)`: the cost for the time step `d`
    (`d` indicates the beginning of the shift).

By default, these functions return a zero value. Otherwise, they must return a JuMP expression (either linear or
quadratic, i.e. a `JuMP.AffExpr` object or anything that JuMP allows as such --- this name is a bit misleading,
as quadratic functions are allowed within an `AffExpr`). To have a sensical objective function, at least one of them
must be implemented.

The function `objective(m::Model, o::ProductionObjective, pm::PlantModel)` computes the whole objective function,
summed over all the time steps and the shifts. It is not meant for customisation by subtypes.

Note: objectives are always minimised (use a sign to maximise).

"""
A linear combination of multiple objective functions. This is a simple way of implementing multiobjective optimisation.

Each objective has a given weight; the corresponding complete objective function is:

    \sum_{i} weight_i f_i

The higher the weight, the more the objective function is important for the optimisation. Negative weights are allowed.
The sum of the weights does *not* have to sum up to one.

Each objective can be assigned a symbol with the `symbols` keyword argument. If no symbols are provided, then
this constructor provides default values: the objectives are given increasing numbers. The first one corresponds
to `Symbol(1)`, the second one to `Symbol(2)`, etc. If symbols are provided, no two objectives can have the same symbol.

Looking up objectives can be done with the functions `hasObjective` and `find`. Both can operate with just the type of
the objective (such as NoObjective or EnergyObjective), or use symbols. There is no guarantee of unicity with a type.
